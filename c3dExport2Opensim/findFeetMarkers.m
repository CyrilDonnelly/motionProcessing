%findFeetMarkers() finds the feet marker label strings
%   Function takes a markers (from a data structure) and searches
%   through the marker data to find the markers with the lowest vertical
%   height, destinguishing them as the foot markers. It is assumed that;
%   Colm 1 is the walking progression (X)
%   Colm 2 is the vertical direction (Y)
%   Colm 3 is the medial/lateral direction (Z)

%                      eg ['RMT1' 'RMT2' 'RCAL' 'LMT1' 'LMT2' 'LCAL']
