motionProcessing
================

Matlab code for processing c3d motion data, doing multiple calculations and modeling in using the OpenSim API. 

This uses the btk_matlab c3d reading function and all the format is based on how this function create the data structure. Btk can be downloaded from here; https://code.google.com/p/b-tk/#Matlab/Octave.

OpenSim is an OpenSource musculoskeletal software package developed at Stanford University. The Matlab and the OpenSim API can be used to run simulations of motion. 

The OpenSim homepage is located here;
